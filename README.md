## Gallery-of-horns app

I built and app and describe the features that it accomplishes. I am including this information in README.md

### Author: Ayrat Gimranov

### Feature #1: Display images

> Given that a user opens the application in the browser, when the user navigates to the home page, then the photo gallery should display all of the images in the gallery

Estimate of time needed to complete: 4 hours

Start time: 9.30 pm

Finish time: 11.40 pm

Actual time needed to complete: 2 hrs 10 mins

### Feature #2: Allow users to vote for their favorite beast

> Given that a user clicks on an image, the number of “favorites” displayed on that image will increase by one.

Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hours

Start time: 11.55 pm

Finish time: 1.23 am

Actual time needed to complete: 1.5 hours

### Feature 3: Bootstrap

> Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the images are displayed on the screen
Then each image should be rendered in a visually pleasing way
The images should be displayed in columns, as screen width allows

Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hours

Start time: 1.30 am

Finish time: 2.50 am

Actual time needed to complete: 1 hr 20 mins

### Stretch Goal: Add Interaction

> Given that a user clicks on an item other than the horned beasts, such as the title of the page or the footer, the information and styles should change.

Actual time needed to complete: 40 mins

Added Interaction: When a user clicks on on the title or the description of the horned beast, the background color of that beast card will change from green to blue and vice versa.
