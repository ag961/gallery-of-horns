# Lab01

## Gallery-of-horns app

I built an app and describe the features that it accomplishes. I am including this information in README.md

In this lab I am building a basib component structure of the application using React.

## Features

- App component renders a Header, Footer and Main component, each of which is defined in their own files.

- App component has an <h1> with a title.

- Footer component contains my name as the author.

- The Main component renders at least two copies of a component called HornedBeasts.

- The Main component passes title, imageUrl, and description into each HornedBeast component.

- The HornedBeast component contains an <h2> that displays the title of the animal, an <img> element with src, alt and title attributes, and a <p> that displays the description.
